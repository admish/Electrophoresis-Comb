# Electrophoresis-Comb
Customizable DNA comb for Bio-Rad Horizontal Electrophoresis Systems

Designed using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), a free program for creating solid 3D CAD objects.  The 3D model is generated using numeric values, allowing anyone to customize it and print their own custom combs.  (No more tape to make larger wells!)
