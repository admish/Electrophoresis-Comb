Customizable DNA comb for Bio-Rad Horizontal Electrophoresis Systems

Designed using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), a free program for creating solid 3D CAD objects.  The 3D model is generated using numeric values, allowing anyone to customize it and print their own custom combs.  (No more tape!)
